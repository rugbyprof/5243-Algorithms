## Polynomial Rolling Hash

Designing a good hash function for string prefixes involves considering a few key properties: uniform distribution of hash values, minimal collision rate, and computational efficiency. A popular and effective approach for hashing strings, including prefixes, is to use a polynomial rolling hash function, often associated with the [Rabin-Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) string search algorithm.

Here's a basic outline of a polynomial rolling hash function for string prefixes:

### Polynomial Rolling Hash Function

The idea is to treat each string as a large number in some base ***b*** , similar to how a number is represented in base 10. Each character's ASCII (or Unicode) value contributes to the hash value, adjusted by its position in the string, and everything is computed modulo some large prime number ***p*** to ensure the hash value stays within a manageable range.

#### Parameters:

- **Base (b)**: A prime number roughly equal to the size of the character set. For ASCII strings, 256 is a common choice. For Unicode, larger primes can be used.
- **Modulus (p)**: A large prime number to ensure the hash value stays within the range of integer types and to reduce collisions.

#### Hash Function:

The hash of a string ***s*** of length ***n*** can be calculated as:

where s<sub>i</sub> is the ASCII value of the i^<sup>th</sup> character in the string.

#### C++ Implementation:

Here's a simple implementation of a polynomial rolling hash function for string prefixes in C++:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

const int b = 256;  // Base: size of the character set (ASCII)
const unsigned long long p = 5381;  // A large prime number

unsigned long long hashString(const std::string& str) {
    unsigned long long hashValue = 0;
    int n = str.length();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        hashValue = (hashValue * b + str[i]) % p;
    }

    return hashValue;
}
```

### Considerations:

- **Modulus Arithmetic**: Using a large prime number as the modulus helps in achieving a uniform distribution of hash values and in minimizing collisions.
- **Overflow Handling**: Depending on the size of strings and the choice of base and modulus, there's a potential for integer overflow. In C++, you can use `unsigned long long` for larger range, and perform modulus operation at each step to keep values in range.
- **Dynamic Hashing for Prefixes**: If you're hashing prefixes of a string dynamically (e.g., adding one character at a time), you can update the hash value incrementally without recalculating from scratch, which is efficient for applications like auto-suggestions.

This polynomial rolling hash function is versatile and provides a good balance between speed and collision resistance for many typical use cases, including hashing string prefixes. However, always test and evaluate your hash function with real-world data relevant to your specific application to ensure it meets your needs in terms of performance and collision rate.
