# **Why Does Heap Sort Run in **`(O(n log n))`**?**

Many assume that Heap Sortâ€™s complexity is primarily due to **building the heap**, which runs in **`(O(n))`**. However, the real reason Heap Sort is **`(O(n log n))`** lies in the **extraction phase**. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

---

## **1. Steps in Heap Sort**

Heap Sort consists of two main phases:

1. **Building the Max-Heap** (turning an unsorted array into a heap).
2. **Extracting the maximum element** repeatedly while maintaining the heap property.

Each of these contributes to the final time complexity.

## **2. Complexity of Building the Heap**

The heap is built using the **heapify (sift-down)** operation.

### **Heapify (Sift-Down) on a Single Node**

- Ensures a node is correctly positioned in a heap by moving it downward if necessary.
- A node may move **at most the height of the tree**, which is **`(O(log n))`**.
- Since a **heap is a complete binary tree**, its height is **`(O(log n))`**.

### **Building the Heap: Bottom-Up Approach**

Instead of inserting elements one by one (**`(O(n log n))`**), we **heapify from the bottom up**, starting with the lowest non-leaf nodes.

- Heapify is called on approximately **`(n/2)`** nodes.
- Most heapify calls take **constant time**, as they operate on nodes near the bottom.
- A careful summation of work across all levels gives an **amortized complexity of **`(O(n))`** for heap construction**.

âœ… **Takeaway:** **Building the heap runs in **`(O(n))`**, not **`(O(n log n))`**.**

---

## **3. Complexity of Heap Sort (Extracting Elements)**

Once the heap is built, we perform **`(n)`** extract-max operations\*\*to remove the root (largest element) and restore heap order.

### **Extracting the Maximum Element**

- Removing the root moves the last element to the root position, followed by **heapify** to restore order.
- Each **heapify** operation takes **`(O(log n))`** time.
- Since we perform **`(n)`** deletions, the total cost is:

```
  O(n log n)
```

âœ… **Takeaway:** **The extraction phase dominates, making Heap Sort **`(O(n log n))`**.**

## **4. Final Complexity Analysis**

| **Phase**                     | **Time Complexity**                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Building the heap             | **`(O(n))`**                        |
| Extracting **`(n)`** elements | **`(O(n log n))`**                  |
| **Total**                     | **`(O(n + n log n) = O(n log n))`** |

Since **`(O(n))`** is dominated by **`(O(n log n))`**, Heap Sortâ€™s final complexity is:

\[
O(n log n)
\]

---

## **Conclusion**

Your intuition about **heap construction being **`(O(n))`** is correct, but the real reason Heap Sort is **`(O(n log n))`** is due to the **`(n)`** extract-max operations**, each requiring **`(O(log n))`** work.
