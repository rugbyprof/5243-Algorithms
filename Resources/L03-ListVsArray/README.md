## Array vs Linked List - A comparison
#### None

- Array is a datatype which is pretty much ubiquitous as a default type in every language. Depending on their use, they are easy to use and fast. However, they are bounded by size and are costly if trying to resize. 
- Linked Lists are not as ubiquitous, but most languages give a similar implementation on par with a vector in C++. Linked lists have no bounded size, and grow and shrink easily (with an overhead cost of managing pointers).
- Lets look more deeply:

| Array is a collection of elements of a *similar data type*.                                                                                                                                      | Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of same type, which are connected to each other using pointers. (*Can you link different types together?*)                                                                                                                     |
| Array supports **Random Access**, which means elements can be accessed directly using their index Hence, accessing elements in an array is fast with a constant time complexity of `O(1)`.       | Linked List supports **Sequential Access**, which means to access any element/node in a linked list, we have to sequentially traverse the complete linked list, up to that element. To access `nth` element of a linked list, time complexity is `O(n)`.                        | In an array, elements are stored in **contiguous memory locations** or in a consecutive manner in the memory. | In a linked list, new elements can be stored anywhere in the memory. The address of the memory location allocated to the new element is stored in the previous node of the linked list, hence forming a link between the two nodes/elements. |
| In an array, **Insertion** and **Deletion** operation takes more time, as the memory locations are consecutive and fixed (assumes moving data to collapse empty cells or insert between values). | In case of linked list, a new element is stored at the first free and available memory location, with only a single overhead step of storing the address of memory location in the previous node of linked list. **Insertion and Deletion** operations are fast in linked list. |
| Arrays can use **Static Memory Allocation** (known at compile time if size is know), or **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (during run time).                                                         | Linked lists use **Dynamic Memory Allocation**. *Is it even possible for lists to use Statically Allocated Memory?*                                                                                                                                                             |
| Arrays have direct access: each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value.                                                                                               | In case of a linked list, each node/element points to the next, previous, or maybe both nodes, meaning no direct access (only sequential).                                                                                                                                      |
| Arrays can be *single-dimensional*, *two-dimensional*, or *multi-dimensional*.                                                                                                                   | Linked lists are *Singly*, *Doubly* or *Circularly* linked. <br>*Could we create a 2D linked list?*                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Size of the array must be specified at time of creation. Resizing the array is costly.                                                                                                           | Size of a Linked list is variable. It grows and shrinks as more nodes are added or removed.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Statically declared arrays get allocated in the **Run Time Stack** , where dynamically declared arrays get allocated in the **Heap**.                                                            | Linked lists are always allocated in the **Heap**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Looking at an image of an array and a linked list, it should be apparent why insertions and deletions (in the middle of the structure) are easy for a linked list, and costly for an array.
